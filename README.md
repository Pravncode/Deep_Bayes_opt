# Scalable Deep Bayesian Optimization for High-Dimensional Antenna Design

This repository contains the source code and supporting files for the work titled **"Scalable Deep Bayesian Optimization for High-Dimensional Antenna Design"**. The framework implements a deep neural network-based surrogate model with Monte Carlo (MC) dropout for uncertainty quantification, integrated within a Bayesian optimization (BO) loop tailored for antenna design problems with large design spaces and multi-output objectives.

## üîç Project Overview

Traditional BO approaches using Gaussian Process (GP) surrogates face scalability issues in high-dimensional and multi-output settings due to their cubic training complexity. This project overcomes such limitations by introducing:

- **DNN surrogate model** with MC Dropout for scalable Bayesian inference  
- **Active sampling strategy** for diverse and informative dataset initialization  
- **Hybrid acquisition strategy** using Expected Improvement (EI) with Differential Evolution (DE) for robust global search  

The framework is validated on a **52-variable tile-based UWB patch antenna**, demonstrating performance improvements over state-of-the-art GP-based methods (TRPBO, SADEA).
